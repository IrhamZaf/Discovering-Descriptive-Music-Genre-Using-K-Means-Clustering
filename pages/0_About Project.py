st.markdown("""
            This project was made in Python, using various packages, including Streamlit, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Joblib. The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle, and it contains over 160,000 tracks from Spotify's API. The dataset was preprocessed using Python, and the K-Means clustering algorithm was used to cluster the tracks into 11 different genres. The K-Means model was then saved using Joblib, and the web app was created using Streamlit.

st.write("The image represents histograms of various audio features within a dataset of tracks, showcasing the data after preprocessing. Each histogram illustrates the distribution of a specific feature, such as acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, liveness, speechiness, tempo, valence, and loudness. Histograms serve as a visual summary of the dataset's characteristics, revealing key insights. For instance, the range of values for each feature (distribution shape) and other relevant information. These processed histograms are instrumental for subsequent data analysis or machine learning tasks, providing a foundation for more in-depth exploration and modeling.")
